<h1>Artificial Intelligence Can See Breast Cancer Before It Happens</h1>

<h3>Summary of an article posted on <em>Towards Data Science</em> linked <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence-can-see-breast-cancer-before-it-happens-4f93e1638539">here</a> by Lambert Leong.</h3>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence and deep learning (neural-networks) in the medical healthcare field has increased at an astonishing rate. AI continues to have a significant impact on medical imaging and deep learning models are constantly being developed to look for anomalies such as bone fractures or possible cancer. Breast cancer is responsible for about 30% of all new female cancers per year (<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html">cancer.com</a>), but the introduction of the breast cancer screening (in the form of mammograms or palpation) has helped to reduce mortality rates. Many have developed AI to detect and segment cancers within a mammogram, yet fewer have developed image-based deep learning models to predict risk. In the work being described, a model was developed to predict an individualâ€™s breast cancer risk; more specifically, interval and screen-detected cancer risk.</p>
<p>There are three clinically relevant outcomes when evaluating risk within a screening population. These outcomes include screen-detected, interval, or no cancer risk. A screen-detected cancer is a cancer that is found as a result of a routine screening mammogram. In this study, it was further defined it as a cancer that occurred within 12 months after a positive screening mammogram. An interval cancer is a cancer that is found between the normal screening interval (biannual or annual) and was defined in the study as an invasive cancer that occurred within 12 months after a negative screening mammogram. Interval cancers are known to grow more rapidly and be more aggressive in biology.</p>
