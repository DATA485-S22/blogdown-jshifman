If this is deployed via netlify, then the repo can be private. 
Since blogdown sites did'nt come from github classroom, i'll provide feedback here in the readme, which you may not want others to see (you could always delete after the semester is over) Or I could provide feedback in a specific section of your leanring journal. You tell me what you want. 
Anyhow, my question is on your first blog post that you found from aother article - it appears on the surface that you're replicating their article on your page, without proper citation. It's totally acceptable to repost information, curation can be just as good as creation, but you have to reword/rewrite/rephrase it as your own.
